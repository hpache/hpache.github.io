Here are a collection of gifs that I captured for my extension! Feel free to look around the website too! I don't have much because I literally started it on Saturday night.

Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are amazingly complicated and a great example of a moshpit of fields in STEM. From the very first time it was presented to the world; physicist, chemists, and biologists have been fixated on trying to determine a mechanism behind the reaction. Knowing basic chemistry, this type of reaction is freaky! Imagine you are doing a titration and see the indicator go off, but then a few moments later the indicator disappears and you have a transparent solution again! This type of behavior would indicate that your titration is going in reverse, which isn't thermodynamically possible. This is basically what happens with Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions.

You may be thinking that the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is breaking physics, but it isn't. Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are special, since they are chemical reactions that happen far away from their equilibrium point. In terms of chemistry, the equilibrium point is thought of the point in which there aren't enough chemicals to cause a reaction or there isn't enough energy to keep driving it. In general, all chemical reactions are driven by thermodynamics! If a mixture does not have enough free energy to drive a reaction, the chemical reaction will stop regardless of the concentrations within the mixture. During a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, chemical concentrations are always decreasing and increasing, but the amount of free energy available is always going to be decreasing. Since the reaction is far away from its equilibrium point, we end up getting ossilations which can be observed with indicators. So in summary, Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions don't break physics because they are driven by the available free energy in the mixture, are far away from equilibrium, and are not driven by the chemical concentrations in the mixture.

The following animations are a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction at different parameters. What the animations show is the concentration of a random chemical A in our mixture, the color isn't special, I just picked because it looked cool.

This first reaction is an example of what someone might think when we say "oscillating chemical reaction." We see that our reaction changes from having a ton of chemical A to barely having chemical A. We also see that there is some sort of periodicity behind the reaction too.

This following reactions are examples of pattern formations in a chemical. The fact that a chemical reaction has a pattern is exciting, but what's even more exciting is that these chemical reactions can potentially explain why animals have spots or stripes. Alan Turing is famously known for kickstarting research into pattern formation in nature.
