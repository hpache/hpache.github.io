Here are a collection of gifs that I captured for my extension! Feel free to look around the website too! I don't have much because I literally started it on Saturday which is fun! 

Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are amazingly complicated and a great example of a moshpit of fields in STEM. From the very first time it was presented to the world, physicist, chemists, and biologists have been fixated on trying to determine a mechanism behind the reaction. Knowing basic chemistry, this type of reaction is freaky! Imagine you are doing a titration and see the indicator go off, but then a few moments later the indicator disappears and you have a transparent solution again! An oscillating chemical reaction shouldn't be possible, but it is!

There are a lot of reasons behind why the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction doesn't break physics, the simplified version is that the concentration of different chemicals are constantly changing. The reason that this is not breaking physics is because the reaction depends on the amount of chemicals left to react, so in reality these reactions don't last forever just until the concentrations reach a certain threshold

The first reaction is an example of what someone might think when we say "oscillating chemical reaction." We see that our reaction changes from having a ton of chemical A to barely having chemical A. We also see that there is some sort of periodicity behind the reaction too.
